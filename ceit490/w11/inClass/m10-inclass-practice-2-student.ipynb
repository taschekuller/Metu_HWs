    "The core idea of agents is to use a language model to choose a sequence of actions to take. In chains, a sequence of actions is hardcoded (in code). In agents, a language model is used as a reasoning engine to determine which actions to take and in which order.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key components of an Agent include a `Language Model` (the cognitive center), `Tools` (for interacting with external systems), and an `Agent Executor` (the runtime environment).\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain offers a variety of pre-built tools, such as Wikipedia, Calculator, and Search engines, and also allows developers to create custom tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "The framework supports the creation of simple and complex agents, from basic search assistants to sophisticated AI systems that interact with multiple data sources and APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents can be customized by creating and integrating custom tools, allowing for flexibility in addressing various real-world problems. Tools provide communication between Agents, chains, chat models, and other external systems and data sources. If an LLM is given a list of available tools and a prompt, it can ask to have one or more tools invoked with the proper inputs."
